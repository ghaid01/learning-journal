**Hello, it's Ghaid!** i think that people with a grown mindset are positive people who never give up and always beleive in themseleves no matter what! They *control* themselves in any situation they go through in their journey of learning and never get nervous about anything because the only thing that can make a dream impossible is to **achieve the fear of failure**
