**Computer Programming** is the process of bulding and designing web pages.

**JaveScript** is a programming language that allows you to make web pages more *interactive*.
- You can use **JavaScript** to select any element,attributeor text from **HTML** pages.
*For example* you can select all the text inside all of the < h1> elements on a page.

*To write a script* you need you first your goal and then list the tasks.

 What is a **function:**

  Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
