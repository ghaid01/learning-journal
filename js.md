**HOW HTML, CSS,& JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER** 


- Web developers usually talk
about three languages that
are used to create web pages:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

- Where possible, aim to keep the
three languages in separate files,
with the HTML page linking to
CSS and JavaScript files.

- Each language forms a separate
layer with a different purpose.
Each layer, from left to right.
builds on the previous one. 


**STATEMENTS**
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

You should write **comments** to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.
