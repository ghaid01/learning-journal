**Computers** were designed to minipulate information and to preform foru different tasks :
1. Take input.
2. Store information.
3. Process.
4. Output the results.
 
 - These four tasks are common to all computers and thats what makes a *computer a computer*.


- **Inputs :** are what the users tell the computer to do.
- **Storage :** is storing the information in memory.
- **Process:** transforming input information into output by using algorithim and then it sends the processed informayion back to the memory until its reaady to be **Output**

- All the info in the computer iscarried in wires and curcuits so if you have a wire with electricity going through it the single key will be 1 for on and 0 for off and that is called a **BIT**.
**BIT**is the smallest piece of info the computer can store.

- With more bits you can represent more complex info.
- Why are smaller computers faster??! Because the smaller the curcuit is the less distance the signal has to go!!

- Curcuits make the computer combine the input signals.
- A curcuit will take 2 electrical signals, if either of the signals is a 0then the result is also a 0 and it gives you a 1 if both signals are 1.

- All of the videos , pictures and structures are made of pixels and each pixel has a color.

**Software** is all of the computer programs or code running on a machine.
- What connects the software with the hardware is **CPU**. 

- Programmers use software languages by using simple commands.
- Such as: 
1. Paython 
2. Ruby 

- The operating system of the computer manages how software gets to use the hardware of the computer.
